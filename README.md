# How to run this Proof of Concept

## Setup

```
$ npm install
```

If you have installed Foundry yet, install it with:

```
$ curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

I ran this PoC locally with the following `forge` version:

```
$ forge --version
forge 0.2.0 (e947899 2022-09-02T00:06:30.659378189Z)
```

## Running the Proof of Concept

```
$ ./run-forge
```
